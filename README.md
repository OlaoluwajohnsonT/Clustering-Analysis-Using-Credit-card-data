# Clustering-Analysis-Using-Credit-card-data
Performing Clustering Analysis on Credit Card data


#INTRODUCTION


In this project, I will perform clustering analysis on a dataset containing information about credit card customers. The dataset consists of 8,950 entries, each representing a customer, and includes 18 columns with various features such as balance, purchase history, credit limits, and more.

My objective is to employ clustering techniques to uncover hidden patterns and segment customers based on their credit card usage behavior. By grouping customers with similar characteristics together, I aim to provide valuable insights for decision-making in the financial industry.

Through exploratory data analysis (EDA), data preprocessing, and clustering algorithms like K-means and hierarchical clustering, I will identify distinct customer segments. These segments can help financial institutions tailor their services and marketing strategies to meet the specific needs of different customer groups.

By the end of this analysis, I intend to provide a clear understanding of how customers are distributed within these clusters and offer insights into the characteristics that define each group. This information can be instrumental in making data-driven decisions, such as optimizing credit offerings, managing risk, and enhancing customer experiences.
